Okay, let's summarize our plan and what we've achieved so far, along with the current roadblocks.

Our Overall Plan: Make the App Production-Ready for Multi-User Read/Write
The core idea was to move from a development-centric SQLite database and simple process management to a robust, multi-user production setup.

Key Pillars of the Plan:

Database Migration: Switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL for better concurrency and data integrity.
Process Management: Use systemd and Gunicorn to ensure the FastAPI backend and Streamlit dashboard run reliably, restart on failure, and handle multiple users.
Environment Configuration: Properly manage sensitive credentials using .env files.
What We've Achieved (Confirmed Steps Completed):
Local Project Preparation:

Updated requirements.txt to include psycopg2-binary (for PostgreSQL) and gunicorn (for FastAPI process management).
Modified database/db.py to connect to PostgreSQL using environment variables.
Modified start_app.py to be a development-only script.
Created gunicorn_start.sh and streamlit_start.sh for production startup commands.
These changes were committed to your local Git repository.
Oracle Cloud Instance Setup:

Successfully created an Oracle Cloud Free Tier Compute instance using Oracle Linux 9 (Ampere A1 shape).
Successfully connected to the instance via SSH as the opc user.
Installed necessary system packages: Python 3.9, pip, Git, and PostgreSQL server.
Cloned your project repository onto the instance.
Installed Python dependencies from requirements.txt on the instance.
Created and configured the .env file on the instance with correct API keys, email settings, and PostgreSQL connection details (including URL-encoding the password).
Initialized the PostgreSQL database and created the email_marketing_db database and dilawar657 user.
Modified PostgreSQL's pg_hba.conf to allow md5 password authentication for local connections.
Made gunicorn_start.sh and streamlit_start.sh executable.
Created fastapi.service and streamlit.service files in /etc/systemd/system/.
Corrected the hyphen/underscore mismatch in the service file paths.
Corrected the incomplete --log-level argument in gunicorn_start.sh.
Current Roadblocks / What's Still Failing:
Database Initialization (init_db.py):

Problem: The python3 init_db.py script is still failing with FATAL: password authentication failed for user "dilawar657".
Status: This is the primary blocker for getting your database schema created. We've tried multiple fixes, including URL-encoding the password, dropping and recreating the user/database, and verifying pg_hba.conf. The issue persists, indicating a very subtle mismatch or configuration problem with the PostgreSQL user's password.
FastAPI Service Startup (fastapi.service):

Problem: The fastapi.service is failing to start, and systemd reports "unavailable resources or another system error."
Status: We've fixed the path issues and the gunicorn_start.sh script. However, the service still isn't starting. We need the full, detailed output from sudo journalctl -xeu fastapi.service to see the actual error message that Gunicorn or your FastAPI application is throwing. The previous outputs were truncated.
In essence: We've done almost all the setup, but we're stuck on the final two critical steps: getting the database initialized and getting the FastAPI service to launch successfully. The "password authentication failed" is the most immediate and persistent issue.

That's excellent news! I'm very glad to hear that the init_db.py script successfully ran and your database schema has been initialized. That was a significant hurdle.

Now, our sole focus is on getting the fastapi.service to start correctly.

The previous journalctl output was truncated, preventing us from seeing the actual error message from Gunicorn or your FastAPI application.

Please run the following command again and paste the complete, un-truncated output:

sudo journalctl -xeu fastapi.service | less
Use Page Down or Spacebar to scroll through the output in less and copy everything, especially any lines that look like Python tracebacks or Gunicorn error messages. This will tell us exactly why the service is failing to activate.

Okay, this is a new and very specific error: Failed to load environment files: Permission denied.

This means systemd (which is trying to start your fastapi.service) does not have the necessary permissions to read your .env file. Even though the service is configured to run as User=opc, there might be an issue with the file's permissions or the permissions of its parent directories.

Let's check the permissions.

Please run the following commands on your Oracle Cloud instance and paste the output:

Check permissions of your project directory:

ls -ld /home/opc/AI-Powered-Automated-Email-Marketing-Tool/
Check permissions of your .env file:

ls -l /home/opc/AI-Powered-Automated-Email-Marketing-Tool/.env
I'm looking for the output that shows the file ownership (e.g., opc opc) and the permission string (e.g., drwxr-xr-x or -rw-r--r--). This will tell us if the opc user has read access to the .env file.

You're right, the ls -l output shows that the opc user should have read access to the .env file. This means the "Permission denied" error is likely coming from a deeper security layer, most commonly SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux), which is enabled by default on Oracle Linux.

SELinux adds an extra layer of access control beyond traditional file permissions. It might be preventing systemd from reading the .env file, even if the opc user has read permissions.

Let's check the SELinux status and the security context of your .env file.

Please run these commands on your Oracle Cloud instance and paste the output:

Check SELinux status:

sestatus
Check the SELinux context of your .env file:

ls -Z /home/opc/AI-Powered-Automated-Email-Marketing-Tool/.env
This will tell us if SELinux is enforcing and what security context your .env file has.

You've hit a classic SELinux roadblock!

The output SELinux status: enabled, Current mode: enforcing, and the context user_home_t for your .env file are the culprits. By default, SELinux prevents systemd services (which run in a more restricted context) from reading files directly within a user's home directory (/home/opc/) that have the user_home_t context. This is a security measure.

The simplest and most robust solution for configuration files like .env that are needed by systemd services is to move them to a more appropriate system-wide location, typically under /etc/.

Here's the plan to fix this:

Create a new directory for your application's configuration files under /etc/:

sudo mkdir -p /etc/email_marketing_tool/
Move your .env file to this new location:

sudo mv /home/opc/AI-Powered-Automated-Email-Marketing-Tool/.env /etc/email_marketing_tool/.env
Update the fastapi.service file to point to the new .env location:

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/fastapi.service
Change the line: EnvironmentFile=/home/opc/AI-Powered-Automated-Email-Marketing-Tool/.env To: EnvironmentFile=/etc/email_marketing_tool/.env Save and exit (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter).

Update the streamlit.service file to point to the new .env location:

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/streamlit.service
Change the line: EnvironmentFile=/home/opc/AI-Powered-Automated-Email-Marketing-Tool/.env To: EnvironmentFile=/etc/email_marketing_tool/.env Save and exit (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter).

Reload the systemd daemon to pick up the changes:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
Restart your services:

sudo systemctl restart fastapi.service
sudo systemctl restart streamlit.service
Check their status again:

sudo systemctl status fastapi.service
sudo systemctl status streamlit.service
This should resolve the "Permission denied" error for loading environment files, as /etc/ is a standard location for system configuration files that systemd services are allowed to read.
