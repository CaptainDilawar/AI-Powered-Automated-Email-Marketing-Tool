This morning, we celebrated the power of teamwork across our entire facility. The Orthopedic unit has been recognized by our patients for the third quarter in a row as the top-performing unit for &quot;Likely to Recommend!&quot; This achievement is a testament to the dedication of our Nurses, Clinical Technicians, Physicians, Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Environmental Services, Nutrition Services, and the entire OR team, who work tirelessly to deliver personalized care.

Additionally, 2C has shown remarkable improvement quarter after quarter and has been honored as the most improved team! When asked about the secret to their success, one caregiver remarked, &quot;We treat our patients and each other like family.&quot; 💖

A big thank you to all our South Hospital Caregivers for the compassionate care you provide our patients every single day. 🙌 #Teamwork #ClevelandClinicMartinHealthSouth Susan Clark, DNP, RN, CNL Rishi Singh Brett Clarke Heidi Lahti Karen Cernock, MBA",2,Your Clinic's Online Presence Awaits,"Hi Clinic Manager in Florida,
